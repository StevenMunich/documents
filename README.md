This is from Years of education and life experience. I am sharing this knowledge because I do not see those learning these fundamentals as competition. There is alot to know in computer science, not just programming. There are security concepts, networking technology, database orginization & management, and business aspects in tech. Business and tech are becoming more and more intertwined and this country needs more job creators. Jobs do not come out of thin air, people need to make them.
